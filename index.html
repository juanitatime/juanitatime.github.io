        <h1>HTML and CSS Concepts</h1>

        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <article>
            <p>HTML, an abbreviation of Hypertext Markup Language, is a programming language for creating electronic
                documents referred to as pages featured across the web. Every page has multiple connections to
                hyperlinks or links to other pages. </br></br> All web pages across the Internet have been crafted by
                the use of some form of HTML. It is an essential requirement for browsers to learn how to display texts
                or perform the loading of different elements.</p>

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <article>
        <ul>
            <li>Html is a programming language with an easy learning curve and offers easy usability.</li>
            <li>The language is also platform-independent.</li>
            <li>Html facilitates the easy addition of videos, images, and audio content to a web page.</li>
            <li>The language can also be used for adding hypertext content to sections of text.</li>
            <li>Html is a markup language and a lot less complex than other languages. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Advantages</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML is easy to learn and use </strong> Most developers find HTML to be one of the most
                easy-to-learn programming languages. Many developers are taught HTML before any other language, and it
                is an integral part of any development course. HTML is easy to learn as it makes use of simple tags, and
                there is no issue with case sensitivity.
            <li><strong>HTML is free </strong>HTML is a free language, and developers do not need to buy any software to
                get started with it. The language does not require users to work with any external plugins and software
                to access key features. This is why many businesses around the world rely on HTML for fulfilling their
                website design requirements. It is possible to have entire websites build in HTML.</li>
            <li><strong>HTML offers support for multiple browsers </strong> HTML is supported by the most widely used
                browsers. Hence, if a website has been written in HTML, there is no concern related to browser support.
                HTML websites can be optimized for the different browsers they can be loaded from. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Not Enough for Dynamic Pages</strong> Using basic HTML is not enough for facilitating many of
                the features that modern websites offer to their users. Developers may find it difficult to add dynamic
                content to web pages with HTML. They are required to learn other languages such as JavaScript, PHP, or
                ASP. </li>
            <li><strong>Limited for Displaying Content</strong> HTML is also not an ideal choice for appealingly showing
                displayed content. This is a limitation most developers are aware of. They have to rely on CSS or
                Cascading Style Sheets to make HTML page content more appealing to the eye. Web designers and developers
                are required to create and maintain two different file sets in some cases. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <article>
            <p>CSS is a programming language used for stating how documents are offered to users in terms of layout and
                style. A document generally refers to a text file structure utilizing a markup language such as the
                widely used HTML and others such as XML or SVG. </br></br> CSS is used for converting a document to a
                usable form for audiences. This is particularly significant for browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and
                Edge built to deliver documents onto screens, printers, and projectors visually.</p>
        </article>
    </section>
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Selectors</strong> CSS selectors are tools for users to pick and handle different elements on a web
            page. They can be referred to as structural components for performing matching of attributes and attribute
            values. New selectors are capable of targetting pseudo-classes to style URL-targetted elements. Selectors
            also encompass a checked pseudo-class for styling checked elements, including radio buttons and checkboxes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Text effects and layout</strong> CSS3 can be used for making different adjustments such as text
            justification change, adjusting a documentâ€™s whitespace, and word hyphenation style.</li>
        <li><strong>First-letter and first-line pseudo-classes</strong> CSS comes with properties that aid in adjusting
            character spaces to enhance the visuals effect and placing drop caps at the beginning of paragraphs. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Advantages</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>CSS saves time</strong> CSS code has to be written once, and the same sheet can be used across
            several HTML pages. A style can be defined for each HTML element, and a user can apply it for multiple web
            pages based on requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Easy maintenance</strong> CSS code is easy to maintain and users can easily make global changes to
            edit the style. Once changes are made, all web pages are automatically updated. </li>
        <li><strong>Changing web standards</strong> HTML attributes are no longer used widely as more users are
            gravitating towards utilising CSS. It is recommended that developers use it across HTML pages to ensure
            compatibility with future browser releases.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cross-browser problems</strong> Making CSS changes on a website can be an easy task for developers.
            But, there is the need to ensure CSS compatibility after the changes have been implemented, as the user
            needs to check if the browsers all display the changes similarly. Checking across browsers is important as
            CSS functions differently across browsers. </li>
        <li><strong>Multiple levels lead to confusion</strong> The CSS programming language has multiple levels, making
            it a confusing prospect for some developers. These include CSS, CSS 2, and CSS 3, which all have slightly
            different specifications. </li>
    </ul>
